## Smart Garbage Locator

### Project Scenario

Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) is planning to launch a web site to optimize
garbage collection, where volunteers within district can report thrown away garbage
and garbage trucks can collect them.
• The registered members of the Green Task Force (GTF) understood here as the
volunteers, can take picture(s) of thrown away garbage, explain the impact such
as attracting wild life, terrible smell, etc., set the location, and report this incident.
• CMC has a dedicated Green Captain, a manager who can view all the reported
incidents (as shown in Figure 1), validate by looking at the uploaded photo(s),
and approve or reject stating how soon the garbage should be cleared.
• Garbage collection staff can see the approved reports with a summary on a Map
along with the importance (set by the captain).
• General public can see the garbage collection spots on a map and news articles
posted by the CMS.
